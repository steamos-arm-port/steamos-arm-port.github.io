# Troubleshooting

## Debug Logs

1. Put an empty file called `debug` on the microSD card's **BOOT** drive.
2. Boot, and reproduce the problem.
3. Attach the `debug-logs` folder from the **BOOT** drive to a
   [GitHub issue](https://github.com/hashtagbasit/SteamOS-ARM-Port/issues).

## Android Doesn't Start After Installing to Internal Storage

Installs made with versions before 1.3 gave the Linux boot partition a type
Android doesn't start next to: the Snapdragon logo shows, then the device
turns off. Changing the type fixes it. It doesn't erase anything, and
the port keeps booting from internal storage.

1. Open **Konsole** in Desktop Mode and find the boot partition:

    ```sh
    readlink -f /dev/disk/by-partlabel/ROCKNIX
    ```

    It prints something like `/dev/sda12`.

2. Change its type, using the number from step 1 (here `12`):

    ```sh
    sudo sfdisk --part-type /dev/sda 12 C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B
    ```

3. Clear Android's leftover data so it sets itself up fresh:

    ```sh
    sudo blkdiscard -f -z /dev/disk/by-partlabel/metadata
    sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk/by-partlabel/userdata bs=1M count=8
    ```

4. Restart holding **Volume Down** and choose Android. The first start takes
   a few minutes while it sets up.

!!! note

    On 1.3 and newer the same fix is
    `sudo ufs-partition.py fix-types` followed by
    `sudo ufs-partition.py reset-android --yes`.

## Black Screen After Booting

- Check the device model in the ABL menu matches your device exactly.
- Re-flash the card. An interrupted flash is the most common cause.
- Collect [debug logs](#debug-logs) and open an issue.

## No Sound

- Open the volume slider in Quick Access and check the output device.
- On the Pocket FIT, run `konkrctl status` and include the output in an issue.
