# Flash to a microSD Card

## Overview

SteamOS ARM Port runs from a microSD card. Android stays on the device and
can still be started from the ABL menu. Once it runs, the Pocket FIT and
Pocket S2 can optionally be [installed to internal storage](internal-storage.md).

## Steps

1. Download the image for your chip from [Downloads](../downloads.md).

2. Flash it to a 32 GB or larger microSD card (A2 speed for best results).

    !!! note

        Common flashing tools are [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/)
        and [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/). If the image comes in `.7z` parts,
        extract the `.001` part first with 7-Zip, WinRAR, Keka or The
        Unarchiver.

3. Flash the ROCKNIX ABL if your device doesn't have it yet, see
   [Flash the ROCKNIX ABL](abl.md). Devices that already show the ROCKNIX ABL
   menu skip this step.

4. Insert the card, then hold **Volume Down** while powering on to open the
   ABL menu.

    !!! note

        The AYANEO Pocket DMG has no Volume Down key, see
        [its page](../devices/pocket-dmg.md).

5. Choose **Set device model** and select your device, set the boot mode to
   **Linux**, and choose **START**.

    !!! note

        On the AYANEO Pocket S2 Pro, select **AYANEO Pocket S2**.

6. The first boot takes a few minutes. Sign in to Steam when it asks.

## Setting a Password

The `steamos` user has no password until one is set. Open **Konsole** in
Desktop Mode and run `passwd`. The password is needed for `sudo`.
