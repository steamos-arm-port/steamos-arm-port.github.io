# Updates

## Overview

The unofficial SteamOS ARM Port updates through Steam's own update button, like a Steam
Deck. Updates download in the background and install on the next restart.
Games, saves, accounts and Wi-Fi settings are kept.

Every update is signed and verified before anything changes, and only
installs on the devices it was made for. An interrupted update rolls back
automatically on the next boot.

## Steps

1. Open **Settings > System**.
2. Select **Check for updates**, then **Apply**.
3. Restart when it asks.

## Without Internet

1. Download the `steamos-arm-<chip>-<version>.sau` file for your chip from
   [Releases](https://github.com/hashtagbasit/SteamOS-ARM-Port/releases).
2. Copy it to a microSD card or USB drive and plug it in.
3. Select **Check for updates**. The update is found on the drive.

!!! note

    Devices on version 1.2 or a beta flash 1.3 once. Updates after that come
    through Steam.
