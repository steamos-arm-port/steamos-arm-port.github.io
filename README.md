# steamos-arm-port.github.io

The website for [SteamOS ARM Port](https://github.com/hashtagbasit/SteamOS-ARM-Port),
built with [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and
published to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`.

## Editing

Pages are Markdown files in `docs/`, the menu is `nav` in `mkdocs.yml`.

```sh
pip install "mkdocs<2" mkdocs-material
mkdocs serve
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:8000.

## Publishing

1. Put this repo at `steamos-arm-port/steamos-arm-port.github.io`.
2. In the repo's **Settings > Pages**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
3. Push to `main`. The site is live at https://steamos-arm-port.github.io a minute later.
